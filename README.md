This is a website that uses NewsAPI (https://newsapi.org/) to fetch news articles pertaining to a certain keyword and category. This web app was built for the Capital One MindSumo challenge (https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/newsapi). 

You can view the deployed website here: https://cooperemily02.github.io/

The NewsAPI will not always return articles for a certain keyword and category, as sometimes no articles can be found. This was handled with a message that says "no articles have been returned." This is a result of an empty JSON object being returned from the API and not a result of a malfunction within the code.
